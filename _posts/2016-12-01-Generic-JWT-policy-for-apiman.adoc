I just pushed an initial (very simple) generic JWT authentication plugin policy to master. It should work with any JWT provider! Let me know how it works for you.

**Update on 23/01/07**: The JWT plugin has now been released to Maven, you can install it via:

G:: io.apiman.plugins 
A:: apiman-plugins-jwt-policy 
V:: 1.2.9.Final (or whatever the latest/matching version of apiman is)

---

Old Instructions:

== Build and install

To try it out immediately you will need to build it from source. Just check out the {apiman-plugins}[apiman/apiman-plugins] repo and execute:

`mvn clean install`

The plugin coordinates will be: 

G:: io.apiman.plugins 
A:: apiman-plugins-jwt-policy 
V:: 1.2.9-SNAPSHOT

It isn't yet as feature-rich as the {kc-oauth2-blog}[Keycloak plugin], but you can:

- Require JWT.
- Require claims (e.g. sub = foo).
- Require transport security (TLS, SSL).
- Require JWT be cryptographically signed (aka. JWS).
- Validate JWT against a provided public key.  
- Remove auth tokens (prevent them reaching the backend).
- Set maximum clock skew.

I'll expand on this in the near future to add some commonly-used features from the Keycloak plugin:

- Extraction of roles for authorization
- +++<s>+++Forward token fields as headers (e.g. X-Sub = sub)+++</s>+++ âœ“

== How to use it

Either:

- Set the `Authorization` header as `Authorization: Bearer <B64 encoded token>`
- Set the `access_token` query parameter as `example.com?access_token=<B64 encoded token>`
