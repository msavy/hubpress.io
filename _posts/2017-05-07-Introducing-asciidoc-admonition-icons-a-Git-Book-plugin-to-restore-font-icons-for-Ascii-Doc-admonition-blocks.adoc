I've been working hard on the {apiman-docs-example}[apiman 1.3.x documentation].
One nice feature of AsciiDoc/Asciidoctor are {admonition-blocks}[admonition blocks]; allowing visually clear and categorised emphasis for the important points.

However, at the time of writing this blog, the {gitbook-asciidoc}[GitBook AsciiDoc] 3.x.x rendering pipeline does _not_ support icons for admonition blocks, providing an inconspicuous, text-only representation:

There are some PRs and GitHub issues with people trying to get this fixed, but none of them has been merged, so I really wanted to provide an interim solution that would still work on the gitbook.com hosted platform.

== Plugin to the rescue.

The solution was to {gitbook-plugin-docs}[create a simple plugin], `asciidoc-admonition-icons` footnote:[Full NPM package name is: `gitbook-plugin-asciidoc-admonition-icons`], that identifies admonition blocks and rewrites the label element to contain the missing glyphs:

The default styling provides a similar look-and-feel to the Asciidoctor's standard theme; with FontAwesome icons and a comparable colour scheme.
Naturally, you can override both the glyphs and styling.

This should hopefully provide a satisfactory workaround until the GitBook team resolve the issue properly in their codebase. 

If you have any problems, please feel free to file an issue.

== Installation & Configuration

In your `book.json`, put `asciidoc-admonition-icons` in your `plugins` array

```json
{
	"plugins": ["asciidoc-admonition-icons"],
}
```

Provide your overrides in `pluginsConfig.admonitions`:

* The 5 standard AsciiDoc admonition types are available:
  * `classes`: CSS classes of the admonition icon container.
  * `title`: HTML title attribute of admonition icon container.
  * `content`: Unicode value of glyph to use.

The entire set of defaults are shown here for illustrative purposes, but you need only provide those you're overriding:

**Example book.json configuration:**
```json
"pluginsConfig": {
    "admonitions": {
        "note": {
            "classes": "fa icon-note",
            "title": "Note",
            "content": "\uf05a"
        },
        "tip": {
            "classes": "fa icon-tip",
            "title": "Tip",
            "content": "\uf0eb"
        },
        "important": {
            "classes": "fa icon-important",
            "title": "Important",
            "content": "\uf06a"
        },
        "caution": {
            "classes": "fa icon-caution",
            "title": "Caution",
            "content": "\uf06d"
        },
        "warning": {
            "classes": "fa icon-warning",
            "title": "Warning",
            "content": "\uf071"
        }
    }
}
```

For example, if we were to override the `important` icon with another glyph:

```json
"important": {
	"classes": "fa icon-important",
    "title": "La ba√±era es muy importante!",
    "content": "\uf2cd"
}
```

Check out the plugin's {gitbook-plugin-docs}[GitBook plugin page], {gh-readme}[GitHub repo] or {npm}[NPM readme] for detailed instructions.

Despite being simple code, quite interesting customisations are possible using a combination of configuration options and CSS. I might add some more sophisticated examples in a future blog post (refer to the docs for some simple ones).
